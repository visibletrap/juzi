Learn Chinese programmer way.

First thing ever that programmer do when they start doing a non-programming activity is to create a program for it.

I'm learning to speak Chinese. Most of the teaching applications out there don't suit my need.
Their course require learner to learn Chinese characters. But I'm not ready to learn the Chinese characters at the moment.
I just want to be able to speak. So I write something for myself.

This application is a sentence remembering application. It starts with displaying a sentence in English.
If you think you know the translation of the sentence in Chinese, you press **y**. It'll then show you the next word. 
Otherwise, press any other key to skip the word. The answer will be shown. The skipped word will be present to your later.
Keep repeating until you passes the whole word lists.

The data behind this application will grow as I learn more sentences from my Chinese teacher.

Hope you enjoy it!
